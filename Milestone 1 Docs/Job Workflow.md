## Uploading STL File Requirements
Backend: storage bucket for jobs + job status

Frontend: interactive front end

Workflow for customer: Prompted with "Are you a customer or a printer" => Dropbox for STL => Filters for material/Infill/Radius => Calculate Price => Confirm listing => Receive Job Status Email

Workflow for printer: Prompted with "Are you a customer or a printer" => Filter for material/Infill/radius => brought to a list of jobs => select job => Share emails => job is deleted from market
