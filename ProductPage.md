## Homepage
The homepage's goal is to attract and inform users about the application services.
Besides this, the homepage acts as a central hub for the application allowing the user access to all other features.
We decided on a clean minimalistic look for the homepage making it easy for the user to focus on the relevant features.
If that is the ones with printing needs or a printer.


## Create Order Page
The Create Order page's purpose is to allow users to create new Orders. The Create Order page is split up into two parts.

### Upload STL
The first step to creating a new order is to upload the user's STL file. As seen below, this menu is quite simple as its only purpose is to receive the STL file.
To ease the upload process, clicking the STL button will open the user's file system, but only display their STL files.

### Configure Order
After uploading the STL file the user gets access to the configuration menu. To simplify this process the configurations are split up into two parts, normal and advanced. 
Normal configurations encapsulate the minimum amount of information a printer needs to complete the job. These are:
 - Quantity
 - Color
 - Material
 - Complete By
 - Comment box
The Material will be defaulted to PLA in case the user doesn't have a preference.
Advanced  will include print-specific requests such Infill Density and Layer Height. All Advanced features will be defaulted to industry standards.

## View Job Page
On the View Job page, prospective printers can view print jobs in their area. Similar to the Create Order page it is split into two parts.

### Select a Job
When accessing the View Job page the first thing a user is confronted with is the select Job menu as seen below. 
This menu allows printers to filter through all the open orders while using the different filter functions to aid their search for a job they can complete.
When a printer has found a job they like they can select it to read all the specific configurations.

### Job Details
This page shows all the details inputted by the customer when they created the job, including their comments. If the Printer likes the specification they can click
the accept job button. This will add the job to the Printer's job page, notify the customer that their job was selected and open a chat dialogue window allowing the two to communicate.  

## Profile Page
The profile page is used to authenticate every user. Allowing the user to provide name, email and location. It also links to the user's order and open job page.

## My Orders Page
The My Orders page allows users to view their open and closed orders. It also provides them with updates on the progress of their open order and the chat windows with each of the Printers, who are currently completing the orders.

## My Jobs Page
The My Jobs Page is the other end of the My Orders page. Here Printers can view their open and complete jobs, update their status and communicate with their customers.
